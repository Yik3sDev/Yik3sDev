Hi! I am Yikes Dev. 
I have been programming for 3 years, however, I have no formal experience in the industry yet.
I primarily write code in Python, however, I have experience in Java, C# and plan to learn rust soon.
I've so far done only desktop applications, however, I would be interested in pursuing web dev at some point.
